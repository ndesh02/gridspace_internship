# Gridspace Internship Application by Neha Deshmukh

## Contact and Availabilty

1. My name is Neha Deshmukh, my email address is n2deshmu@uwaterloo.ca and my phone number is 289-926-7906.
2. I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo and my anticipated graduation date is April 2025.
3. My preferred start date is January 2023 and the end date would be the end of April.
4. I would love to work in Los Angeles!

## Technical Background
1. I have taken a course on C++, a course on Systems Programming and Concurrency that used C, a course on Data Structures and Algorithms and a course on Digital Computers that taught RISC-V. I have learned 

2. My largest software project was a customer facing mobile app that was used for logging covid and drug tests. There were multiple facets to the project: cases where customers would log the results for their own usage, cases where employees would log their results so that they would be automatically sent to their employer, and cases where the results needed to be automatically uploaded into an ATS (Application Tracking System). I also took the initiative to create an external site to interface with some of the customer data (useful for large corportations to track and download drug test results en masse) and created a secure website from scratch in 2 weeks. This involved the use of multiple technologies: Xamarin (used to develop iOS and Android applications), Razor pages (for the external site) and APIs to send requests to the ATS and the development of our own API endpoints.

3. I'd say that I am fairly comfortable with Systems Programming. I am taking a course on it right now, so by the time Winter 2023 comes around I should be fairly proficient. I also know C quite well, and am fairly comfortable with all the lower level aspects such as memory management. I have taken a course on Digital Computers that taught us assembly (RISC-V) so I am comfortable with low level programming.

4. I have a wide variety of things I like to do in my free time. Recently, I have been reading quite a bit of historical fiction as well as non-fiction. I also enjoy listening to podcasts about modern history. Another hobby of mine is painting. I taught myself how to paint landscapes a year ago and I find it to be a good creative outlet, especially when I am stressed. I have also learnt how to crochet recently and enjoy making a lot of stuffed toys - they make great birthday gifts! One last hobby of mine is playing Stardew Valley - I got into it a few years ago and haven't been able to stop playing since. These are a few of the things I like to do in my free time and some others haven't made it onto the list.

5. One personal project that I made for fun was a game called Fox vs Bats. I used the open source game engine, Godot, to create this project. The reason I decided to start creating the game was out of a desire to learn how to use a game engine. I had downloaded Unity, but I liked the idea of the open source engine more and all of the fundamental concepts were the same I learnt about game design and the tradeoffs of frames per second versus computing power consumed. Once I was done, my game had 10 playable levels and I distributed it amongst friends and family. 

6. My background in math is solid. I have taken 3 calculus courses in university, and have learned Fourier series. This has helped me model signals and systems. I have also taken discrete math courses and am currently taking probability and statistics. In addition, I have also taken the Machine Learning Course on Coursera by Stanford University and this taught me the fundamentals and math behind artifical intelligence.

7. I think that good code isn't littered with comments or overly clever - it should be self explanatory. Comments should be added where explanations are needed, but for the most part the variable names and the structure should be apparent. I also think it's best to take the most straightforward solution (without compromising on efficiency). This will help maximize readability as well - another feature of good code. It's also important to organize the code in small chunks such as classes, methods and functions that do one thing to maximize reusuability. Finally, good code must actually work. This means that it has been tested and rewritten as needed.

Contrasting C and Python: 
- In python, variables are untyped. So, you don't need to declare them. In C, you must declare the variable before using it. You can also decide whether to allocate it on the stack or the heap. When allocating on the heap, it's best practice to initialize all your variables (for example an entire array) to some default value in order to avoid future hard to debug issues. 
- In C, it's best to avoid passing by value and better to use pointers (or pass by reference). In python, pointers aren't available so you must pass by value.
- In C, it's best to explicitly compare values (don't rely on truthiness). This also helps improve the readability of the code. Since python variables are untyped, this is less important in python.
- In C, always use { } to open and close statements. This helps improve readability and avoid bugs. Since python relies on indentation, this is not the case in that language.

8. I've heard great things about Gridspace and would love the opportunity to work for you! I am most excited to develop my machine learning and AI skills since I know that you are creating cutting edge AI technology. I have also heard that this is a fast paced work environment, and I want to develop my problem solving skills.
